title: "Practical Forecasting in R with fable & modeltime"
subtitle: "A short, example–driven book"
---

This book is a compact, opinionated guide to modern time series forecasting in R, with a focus on:

- Classical, statistically principled methods using the **fable** ecosystem.
- Machine–learning–style forecasting using **modeltime**, **tidymodels**, and friends.
- Practical extensions for retail and supply–chain–flavoured data: promotions, prices, hierarchies, and global models.
- Optional **AutoML** and scalable modelling using **H2O**.

The style is example–led: every concept is tied to runnable R code.

You can read it straight through, or jump to the part that matches how you work today:

- Part I: fable
- Part II: modeltime + tidymodels
- Part III: Extensions (promos, hierarchies, feature engineering, global vs per–SKU)
- Part IV: AutoML with H2O
